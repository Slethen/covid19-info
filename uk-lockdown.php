<h3>When can you leave home?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible</li>
	<li>One form of exercise a day - for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household</li>
	<li>Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person</li>
	<li>travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home.</li>
</ul>

  <h4 class="alert-heading">Enforcement</h4>
  <b>If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.</b>
</div>


<p>That’s all - these are the only reasons you should leave your home.</p>
<p>You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No.</p>
<p>You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home.</p>
<p>You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can.</p>
<p>If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.</p>
